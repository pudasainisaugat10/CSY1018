		<h1>About Assignment</h1><hr>				
						<p>

						<p>
					The assignment was given on 2021, Tuesday May 11, 9:05 PM through via mail. When the mail came I was unknown about the assignment and after that our course lecturer Mr. Ankit Thapa send us mail on Sunday May 16, 8:25 PM for discussion class on assignment. Similarly on Wednesday May 19, we got another mail from our lecturer for another discussion class. The purposed of the assignment was to asses our ability to create a web page using HTML and CSS and managing our code using GitHub. We was tasked to develop a website with at least five pages that are Homepage, Portfolio, Contact, Curriculum Vitae and Report. In addition to the website we need to make a short video brief about our web design. After the completion of give task we had to submit our assignment through NILE (NORTHAMPTON INTEGRATED LEARNING ENVIRONMENT).</p>

					<h1>About My Experience</h1><hr>
					<p>As we all know, website means a related collection of World Wide Web (WWW) files that includes a beginning file called a home page. Generally a website is not only of one page, it can be one or more than one pages. Due to Novel Corona (Covid-19) virus our physical classes were stop and our classes were in online so our online classes were less effective than physical classes  After 2 days of assignment given I started to code  for my first HTML page i.e. home page. When I was doing the assignment I was unknown about many things like about design, fonts, colors and many others. I started to research on given HTML pages to collect information and ideas to start to make my website. After working for an hour I made a home page. I took references from different websites, YouTube and from others Medias. We need to push our work daily in GitHub. I had no ideas about GitHub and in our google classroom there is slides about git commit and git push and there is recording video about how to push code on GitHub I watch and I get the knowledge about GitHub. After that I push my first code in GitHub on May 21, 2021. For the first time I had a problems but after watching the slides and video its make me easy to push. </p>

					<p>While making the index.html (homepage) I found an issue on many things like size, fonts, background-image, color and other things, with hard work I solve all the issues and got effective result on output. After another day I started coding for my next HTML page i.e. Portfolio page. I had no idea what portfolio is and then I start to do research on portfolio on different website, I watched different videos on YouTube. After someday our term II course begins through online and our lecturer Ankit sir gave some information about portfolio it made me easier to code for portfolio. For this page I used grid-columns to demonstrate my skills. After that I push my code in GitHub on May 25, 2021. After making the portfolio page I took 2 days to make contact page. In 2 days I collected the ideas and information to make a contact page. After then I planned to execute the ideas but I had an issue on my network problem for a day. Next day I started to code for contact page, and then I get the effective result on my output. After then I push my code in GitHub on May 31, 2021. After that I need to make CV page i.e. cv.html for my website. We haven’t taught how to make CV in our classes. I had a little bit problem while making CV, it’s difficult to make without any knowledge, without any ideas. After that I research on different Medias how to make a CV. Similarly, I had already made a CV through Microsoft office word when I was in higher education level. To make CV for my website I need to code, I need to insert columns, I need to put design and colors through HTML and CSS. After that I started to code, I code about my personal information, my hobbies, my skills, about my academic qualification, my strengths and declaration. While making the CV page I had issue on many things like my fonts, positions, background and others. Slowly I solved all the issues and made a beautiful CV for my website and after completion of my CV page I push my code in GitHub on June 2, 2021.</p>

					<h1>My Interest on Codding</h1><hr>
					<p>Many people are interested to be an IT specialist, to build a webpage, software and to do coding. Similarly I am also interested to be an IT specialist, to build a webpage, software and to do coding. It’s an honor to make this website in the beginning of our 1st educational year. It was an unexpected assignment for us.  After the assignment given I feel difficult to perform the given task through HTML and CSS. At first I had many issues, problems, difficulties and error while making the web page. This is my 1st time experience of making the web page through HTML and CSS. In the beginning I had no interest on making this web page because of less ideas, less information, less skills and less techniques to make the webpage. Similarly working on the assignment on daily basis slowly my interest increasing on it. While doing the work many error occurs and it gives pressure but solving the error and finding the solutions was the more interesting in making the webpage. </p>

					<h1>About my Design, Colors and Fonts</h1><hr>
					<p>Web design is the process of creating a website. Web design contains several different aspects, including web page layout, content, text and many others. Generally website are created using a marking language called HTML. Web designers build their webpage using HTML tags that defines the content and data of each pages. Similarly my web page design is in simple and attractive form. I used background-image to make my web page more attractive. Inserting background-image in web page adds the visual interest to a page and helps us to achieve the design we are looking for. I used social media links in my webpage. It make it easier to the audience to find the other content through the website. I used grid-columns to achieve pixel perfect website layouts. To make my web page attractive I used many different tags and codes like display inline-block, float left, position fixed and other tags too, it helps to achieve the perfect website layout design.</p>
					<p>Colors are the first things people notice when they visit our website. Colors scheme can make a huge impact on colors both style and consistency. Consistency is actually one of the fundamental values in creating a color scheme for the website. Web designers use HTML and CSS tags to insert different color in webpage. Similarly for my web page I used different colors like white, black, dark and light color, red and marron. For the designing web page I used white and black color more than other colors. For main text mainly I used white and black color. I used dark color for background image, light color and white color for footer, red for page layout and marron for the text. Using the colors made my website more attractive.</p>
					
					<p>
                     Fonts play a major role in shaping the brand language and website design. Fonts make the website unique, perfect and attractive. Basically fonts are used to format the text on website. People are more familiar with Arial, Helvetica and Times New Roman for designing the website. Especially font choice is important for branding and it helps convey brand values and personality. Fonts also impact how effectively people can view and navigate your website. Similarly for my web page I used different fonts for the different headings and different font size for different text. I used normal font style for my all three pages but for the contact.html and cv.html page I used italic and oblique font style. Font size are different for all the pages. For the all text I used text-align justify to make it more perfect and attractive and putting the perfect font style and font size helps to achieve the perfect web page.</p>
