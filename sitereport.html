Similarly on Wednesday May 19, we got an email from our lecturer for another discussion class. After that I started to research on given topic. The purpose of the assignment is to asses our ability to create a web page using HTML and CSS and managing our code using GitHub. We was tasked to develop a website with at least five pages that are Homepage, Portfolio, Contact, Curriculum Vitae and Report. In addition to the website we need to make a short video brief about our web design.

					<h1>About My Experience</h1><hr>
					<p>Due to Novel Corona (Covid-19) virus our physical classes were stop and our classes were in online so our classes were less effective than physical classes  After 2 days of assignment given I started coding for my first HTML page i.e. home page. When I was doing the assignment I was unknown about many things like about design, fonts, colors and many others. I started to research on given HTML pages. After working for hour I made a home page. I took references from different websites, YouTube and from others. We need to push our work daily in GitHub. I had no ideas about GitHub and in our google classroom there is slides about git commit and git push and there is recording video to I watch and I get the knowledge about GitHub. After that I push my first code in GitHub on May 21, 2021. For the first time I had a problems but after watching the slides and video its make me easy to push. </p>

					<p>While making the index.html (homepage) I found an issue on many things like size, fonts, background-image, color and other. With hardworking I solve all the issues and got effective result on output. After another day I started coding for my next HTML page i.e. Portfolio page. I had no idea what portfolio is and then I start to do research on portfolio on different website, I watched different videos on YouTube. After someday our term II course begins through online and our lecturer Ankit sir gave some information about portfolio it made me easier to code for portfolio. For this page I used grid-columns to demonstrate my skills. After that I push my code in GitHub on May 25, 2021. After making the portfolio page I took 2 days to make contact page. In 2 days I collected the ideas and information to make a contact page. After then I was planned to execute the ideas but I have an issue on my network problem for day. Next day I started to code for contact page, and then I get the effective result. After then I push my code in GitHub on May 31, 2021. </p>
