Similarly on Wednesday May 19, we got another mail from our lecturer for another discussion class. The purposed of the assignment was to asses our ability to create a web page using HTML and CSS and managing our code using GitHub. We was tasked to develop a website with at least five pages that are Homepage, Portfolio, Contact, Curriculum Vitae and Report. In addition to the website we need to make a short video brief about our web design.

					<h1>About My Experience</h1><hr>
					<p>Due to Novel Corona (Covid-19) virus our physical classes were stop and our classes were in online so our online classes were less effective than physical classes  After 2 days of assignment given I started to code  for my first HTML page i.e. home page. When I was doing the assignment I was unknown about many things like about design, fonts, colors and many others. I started to research on given HTML pages to collect information and ideas to start to make my website. After working for an hour I made a home page. I took references from different websites, YouTube and from others Medias. We need to push our work daily in GitHub. I had no ideas about GitHub and in our google classroom there is slides about git commit and git push and there is recording video about how to push code on GitHub I watch and I get the knowledge about GitHub. After that I push my first code in GitHub on May 21, 2021. For the first time I had a problems but after watching the slides and video its make me easy to push. </p>

					<p>While making the index.html (homepage) I found an issue on many things like size, fonts, background-image, color and other things, with hard work I solve all the issues and got effective result on output. After another day I started coding for my next HTML page i.e. Portfolio page. I had no idea what portfolio is and then I start to do research on portfolio on different website, I watched different videos on YouTube. After someday our term II course begins through online and our lecturer Ankit sir gave some information about portfolio it made me easier to code for portfolio. For this page I used grid-columns to demonstrate my skills. After that I push my code in GitHub on May 25, 2021. After making the portfolio page I took 2 days to make contact page. In 2 days I collected the ideas and information to make a contact page. After then I planned to execute the ideas but I had an issue on my network problem for a day. Next day I started to code for contact page, and then I get the effective result on my output. After then I push my code in GitHub on May 31, 2021. After that I need to make CV page i.e. cv.html for my website. We haven’t taught how to make CV in our classes. I had a little bit problem while making CV, it’s difficult to make without any knowledge, without any ideas. After that I research on different Medias how to make a CV. Similarly, I had already made a CV through Microsoft office word when I was in higher education level. To make CV for my website I need to code, I need to insert columns, I need to put design and colors through HTML and CSS. After that I started to code, I code about my personal information, my hobbies, my skills, about my academic qualification, my strengths and declaration. While making the CV page I had issue on many things like my fonts, positions, background and others. Slowly I solved all the issues and made a beautiful CV for my website and after completion of my CV page I push my code in GitHub on June 2, 2021.
